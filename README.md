# What is this?

Use this repo to explore different flows we can use to show off React Flow in a
hero element on the homepage.

## What do we have so far?

- [x] A copy of the "editor" flow from our current home page.
- [x] A mindmap flow.
- [x] A simple workflow builder.

## Todo

- [ ] Cycle each flow on a timer.
  - [ ] Pause the cycle if the user interacts with a flow.
- [ ] Have slick transitions between flows.
  - Check out tween.js
  - Check out react-sprint
- [ ] Update design based on Facu's mockups.
- [ ] Make the flows properly interactive.
